0.5 when hosting, use cron to delete unapproved events after four days

1. Create approval for calendars too (no edit or delete though)
1.3. Do it for locations

2. Add pending/approved events on user page

3. Admin
	-Allow admins to see all pending events and approve them from the page
	-Pass in a form with check boxes to delete the checked ones

Save calendar preferences with ajax if logged, else use sessions

4. have ability to change between month, week, and day views without reloading
5. maybe delete and edit events without reloading page
6. Use session data to keep calendar filter choices
7. Make it so recurring events acutally create multiple events (use an 'EventGroup' model to associate them)
