0.5 when hosting, use cron to delete unapproved events after four days

delete event views and emails

1. Create approval for calendars too (no edit though)

2. Use email
	-Add pending/approved events on user page

3. Admin
	-Allow admins to see all pending events and approve them from the page

Host it, eventually.
Continue styling...

4. have ability to change between month, week, and day views without reloading
5. maybe delete and edit events without reloading page
6. Use session data to keep calendar filter choices
7. Make it so recurring events acutally create multiple events (use an 'EventGroup' model to associate them)
